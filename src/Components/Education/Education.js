                <h3> Ingredients to Use</h3>

                <p>Alcohol: A group of organic compounds that come in a variety of forms, some of which are 
                    good and some of which are bad. Good alcohols have a high molecular weight, while 
                    lowâ€“molecular weight alcohols are bad. The bad forms to look for are ethanol or 
                    ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl 
                    alcohol, all of which can be drying, sensitizing, or damaging to the skin's moisture 
                    barrier.<br/>
        
                <br/>Aloe Vera: A popular plant extract that soothes and hydrates the skin while providing 
                    antioxidant benefits. While aloe is not as miraculous as the skincare industry sometimes
                     likes to make it seem, it does have refreshing effects for irritated or sunburnt skin.<br/>

                    <br/>Alpha-Hydroxy Acid (AHA): Exfoliating ingredients that are either manufactured synthetically
                     are derived from milk and fruit sugars. AHAs break down the glue that holds dead skin cells 
                     together for a brightening effect. The most common and effective AHAs are lactic acid and 
                     glycolic acid.<br/>

                    <br />Antioxidants: A group of natural and synthetic ingredients that protect skin against 
                    environmental stressors like free radicals. Popular antioxidants include vitamins E and C, 
                    lycopene, green tea, and niacinamide.<br/>
                    
                    <br />Argan Oil: A moisturizing, fragrance-free plant oil made from the kernels of argan trees. 
The oil contains skin-benefiting lipids, fatty acids, and antioxidants. This is another oil that's 
highly hyped up in the cosmetics world, but its use is merely for dry skin and hair and is no more
 beneficial than other plant oils, like coconut, jojoba, avocado, or rapeseed oil. Used in excess, 
 the product can get greasy.<br/>

 <br/>Beta-Hydroxy Acid (BHA): Oil-soluble exfoliants that penetrate pores deeply to clear acne and blackheads. 
 Salicylic acid is the most common BHA in skincare.<br/>
